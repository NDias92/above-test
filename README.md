# Base idea of the challenge

This is the base idea for the layout:

[Project Idea](./src/img/base-image.png)

The first three inputs are to look for an existent episode on the database.
The buutton is to handle that search.

The logo created for the challenge was:

[Logo Idea](./src/img/movie.logo.png)

The next step is to create the form to create a new episode if none were found

[Create Idea](./src/img/create-image.png)

The inputs should be the ones needed from the graphql side to create a new episode

<div align="center" style="border: 2px solid black; padding: 20px; width: 200px; margin: 0 auto;">
  <p><strong>ID</strong></p>
  <p><strong>series</strong></p>
  <p><strong>title</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Season</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Episode</strong></p>
</div>

Then the focus should be on the update/delete form:

[Update Idea](./src/img/update-image.png)

Using the same type of inputs created previously but adding an extra button, one should be to handle the update, the other to delete.

Finally, there will be a little form to check the OMDB:

[OMDB Idea](./src/img/OMDB-form-image.png)

There should only be two inputs, so the search can focus on looking by name and/or year of the movie.

[OMDB Search Idea](./src/img/OMDB-search-image.png)

the information received should be displayed on a tabled, where the image should be the main focus and the information received on the table field.

The git project should work on both GraphQL and Locally (the main branch was developed to work with both API and GraphQL requested and to see how it's working in local mode the branch to do so is localTesting).

<div align="center" style="border: 2px solid black; padding: 20px; width: 200px; margin: 0 auto;">
  <p><strong>THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND HOPE TO TALK SOON</strong></p>
    <p><strong>NADIA DIAS</strong></p>
</div>
